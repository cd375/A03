        Definitions:
        
        GIT- Git is an extremely popular version control system that is at the heart of a wide variety of high-profile 
        projects. Git is installed and maintained on your local system (rather than in the cloud) and gives you a 
        self-contained record of your ongoing programming versions.
        
        GITHUB- GitHub is designed as a Git repository hosting service. It‚Äôs an online database that allows you to keep
         track of and share your Git version control projects outside of your local computer/server. 
        
        Repository- Repository in Git could be considered similar to your project folder that Git could track all the 
        changes happening inside the folder.
        
        Clone- git clone is primarily used to point to an existing repo and make a clone or copy of that repo at in a 
        new directory, at another location. The original repository can be located on the local filesystem or on remote
         machine accessible supported protocols. The git clone command copies an existing Git repository.
        
        Commit- The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository.
        
        Push- let the server know about the local changes we had committed
        
        Pull- you are downloading the latest snapshot of git to your local machine
        
        Branch- allows you to separate from the mainline (with the entire history of the project at that point) so that 
        your further development doesn't disturb other works.
        
        Merge- merge our branch to master. To merge branches, make sure to checkout to destination branch
        
        Merge Conflict- happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person 
        edits a file and another person deletes the same file.
        
        Fetch- The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project that 
        you don‚Äôt have yet.
        
        Remote- common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes
